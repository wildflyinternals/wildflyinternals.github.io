I'm reading the book _Grokking Algorithm_[^grok] recently, and it introduces _Dijkstra's Algorithm_ in chapter 7. Here is a java implementation I've written:

    }

    public Map<String, String> getPath() {
        return path;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Graph g = new Graph();
        g.addEdge("start", "a", 1);
        g.addEdge("start", "b", 1);
        g.addEdge("a", "b", 1);
        g.addEdge("b", "c", 1);
        g.addEdge("a", "c", 1);
        g.addEdge("c", "fin", 1);
        g.addEdge("b", "fin", 1);
        System.out.println(g);

        g.dijkstra();
        System.out.println(g.getPath());
        System.out.println(g.generatePath());
    }
}
```

I'll introduce the above implementation in this article. Firstly, the usage is like this:

```java
 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Graph g = new Graph();
        g.addEdge("start", "a", 1);
        g.addEdge("start", "b", 1);
        g.addEdge("a", "b", 1);
        g.addEdge("b", "c", 1);
        g.addEdge("a", "c", 1);
        g.addEdge("c", "fin", 1);
        g.addEdge("b", "fin", 1);
        System.out.println(g);

        g.dijkstra();
        System.out.println(g.getPath());
        System.out.println(g.generatePath());
}
```

The above code created a `Graph` class, and added _edges_ into the _graph_, and then the `dijkstra()` method is executed to calculate the _cheapest path_. Here is the execution result:

```
Graph{edges=[{start->a / 1}, {start->b / 1}, {a->b / 1}, {b->c / 1}, {a->c / 1}, {c->fin / 1}, {b->fin / 1}]}
Initial costs: {a=1, b=1, c=2147483647, fin=2147483647}
Updated cost:a=1
Updated cost:b=1
Updated cost:c=2147483647
Updated cost:fin=2147483647
next cheapest: b
Updated cost:a=1
Updated cost:b=1
Updated cost:c=2
Updated cost:fin=2
next cheapest: a
Updated cost:a=1
Updated cost:b=1
Updated cost:c=2
Updated cost:fin=2
next cheapest: c
{b=start, c=b, fin=b}
fin <- b <- start
```

We can see how the path costs are updated in each iteration, and how the final path is calculated at last. Here is the class diagram:

![Class Diagram]({{ site.url }}/assets/dig-class.png)

The `Graph` class is to store the structure _DAG_, of which the full name is _Directed Acyclic Graph_. The `Graph` contains a lot of _edges_, so the `Edge` class is to represent the structure.

Here are the attributes in `Edge` class:

```java
class Edge {
    private String from;
    private String to;
    private int weight;
}
```

`from` and `to` are two nodes of connected by the edge. We use `String` as node class. This is okay because we don't allow different nodes to have same name. The `weight` attribute is straight-forward and it stores the weight of this edge for calculation. Because `Graph` contains many _edges_, so in `Graph` class, we store these edges like this:

```java
private List<Edge> edges = new ArrayList<>();
```

We also need to store all the _nodes_ in graph for later calculation:

```java
private Set<String> nodes = new HashSet<>();
```

Please note we use `Set<String>` to store the `nodes`, because `Set` type will not store entries with same value. This can ensure no duplicated nodes will appear in the data structure. The next important data structure is the _cost table_:

```java
private Map<String, Integer> costs = new HashMap<>();
```

This table stores the _weight sum_ from the start point to the target node. During calculation process, this table will be keep updated.

Another important thing is that we use `Map<String, Integer>` type to store the _node <-> weight sum_ pairï¼Œbecause the `Map` type is simliar to the `Set` type, it won't accept duplicate key value, which means it won't contain multiple entries for same `node`.

If we put a _String <-> Integer_ pair with an existing `String` value in `Map`, it will just update the existing entry. That is just what we need: to update the _node <-> weight sum_ entry with new value.

We also need to mark the _start node_ and the _end node_ of a graph, and here are the relative attributes in `Graph` class:

```java
private String start = "start";
private String fin = "fin";
```

We can compare the node name in calculation process to check if it is start or end point. Now let us check the methods in `Graph`:

```java
public void addEdge(String from, String to, int weight) {
    edges.add(new Edge(from, to, weight));
    nodes.add(from);
    nodes.add(to);

    if (from.equals(start)) {
        costs.put(to, weight);
    } else if (costs.get(to) == null) {
        costs.put(to, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}
```

The purpose of above method is to add an _edge_ into _graph_:

```java
edges.add(new Edge(from, to, weight));
```

And also add the two nodes of the edge into `nodes` set:

```java
nodes.add(from);
nodes.add(to);
```

We do not need to worry that we will add duplicate nodes into `nodes` set, because the type of `nodes` is `Set`, it does not contain duplicate entries with same value. Adding the `String` with same value will just overwrite the existing one. The next important task of `addEdge` is to update the `costs` table:

```java
if (from.equals(start)) {
    costs.put(to, weight);
} else if (costs.get(to) == null) {
    costs.put(to, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
}
```

We need to consider two conditions as shown above: Firstly, we need to check if the added edge is connected with start point. If so, we need to save the true weight into `costs` table, because they are initial edges need to be calculated by the algorithm.

Otherwise, we just use `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the weight of the edge, because we do not want the algorithm to pick up these edges in initial calculation. During the calculation process, the true costs of these edges can be fetched from the `weight` attribute of `Edge` class later for calculation. Please note this condition:

```java
else if (costs.get(to) == null)
```

We need to check whether `costs` table contains the `to` node of the added edge, in case the weight value is overwrittee. This is important because the node connecting with start node may be part of multiple edges, and the edge that is not connecting with start node may overwrite the weight value of this node. Here is the diagram for example:

![Graph]({{ site.url }}/assets/dij01.jpg)

As the diagram shown above,  _b_ is connected with both _start_ and _c_, so it belongs to two edges: _start -> b_ and _b -> c_. In this case, if we add edge _start -> b_ firstly, the cost of b will be 1 in `costs` table.

But if we add edge _b -> c_ later, the cost of b will be updated with value `Integer.MAX_VALUE` if we don't check the existing value in `costs` table, and then the algorithm will fail because the initial weight of _b_, which is connected with start node, is not correct. Now let's see `nextCheapestNode()` methodï¼š

```java
private String nextCheapestNode() {
    if (nodes.size() == processed.size()) // all nodes are processed
        return null;

    int cheapest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String cheapestNode = null;

    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> cost : costs.entrySet()) {
        System.out.println("Updated cost:" + cost);
        if (cost.getValue() <= cheapest && !processed.contains(cost.getKey())) {
            cheapest = cost.getValue();
            cheapestNode = cost.getKey();
        }
    }
    System.out.println("next cheapest: " + cheapestNode);
    return cheapestNode;
}
```

This method is to find the next cheapest node that is not processed yet. Here is the important part:

```java
if (cost.getValue() <= cheapest && !processed.contains(cost.getKey()))
```

We used a `processed` list to store the nodes that have been processed in `Graph`:

```java
private List<String> processed = new ArrayList<>();
```

After all the nodes are calculated, then all the nodes should be in `processed` list. Here is the end condition:

```java
if (nodes.size() == processed.size()) // all nodes are processed
    return null;
```

We need to initialize the `processed` list in `Graph` like this:

```java
{
    processed.add(start);
    processed.add(fin);
}
```

Because start and end nodes will never be calculated and they are already processed. Now let us check the entry function:

```java
public void dijkstra() {
    System.out.println("Initial costs: " + costs);

    String node = nextCheapestNode();

    path.put(node, start);
    while (node != null) {
        int cost = costs.get(node);
        Set<Edge> neighbors = findNeighbors(node);
        for (Edge neighbor : neighbors) {
            int newCost = cost + neighbor.getWeight();
            if (costs.get(neighbor.getTo()) > newCost) {
                costs.put(neighbor.getTo(), newCost);
                path.put(neighbor.getTo(), neighbor.getFrom());
            }
        }
        processed.add(node);
        node = nextCheapestNode();
    }
}
```

This function will find the first node to calculate:

```java
String node = nextCheapestNode();
```

Then it will enter the calculation loop to calculate all the nodes in graph according to the algorithm:

```java
while (node != null)
```

In the loop, the function will find the next cheapest node, calculate the path weight, and update the `costs` table. In additon, it will generate the `path`:

```java
private Map<String, String> path = new HashMap<>(); // to -> from
```

The `path` is the `parent` data structure in the book, it contains the _to -> from_ data pair. We can use this data structure to generate a complete path from end to start.

Why it's from end to start? It's determined by the algorithm calculation process, we may have some orphan paths in above data structure as the result of updated costs calculation, but we can always find a sole path from end to the start.

During the calculation process, if it finds a cheaper path, the `from` of a `to` will be updated, so we use `to` as _key_ and `from` as _value_. In this way, where is the `to` from is always unique, and some _to -> from_ entries will become orphan and useless. But that doesn't matter, because we get a unique _to <- from <- to <- from_ path. We can clear `path` data easily. Finally let's recheck the usage of the codes:

```java
Graph g = new Graph();
g.addEdge("start", "a", 1);
g.addEdge("start", "b", 1);
g.addEdge("a", "b", 1);
g.addEdge("b", "c", 1);
g.addEdge("a", "c", 1);
g.addEdge("c", "fin", 1);
g.addEdge("b", "fin", 1);
```

The above codes will create this graph:

![Graph]({{ site.url }}/assets/dij02.jpg)

Then we execute the algorithm:

```java
g.dijkstra();
```

And finally we print out the path:

```java
System.out.println(g.generatePath());
```

The `generatePath()` is to print the path from _end_ to _start_ by using `path` data:

```java
private String generatePath() {
	StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();
	String next = null;
	for (Map.Entry<String, String> p : path.entrySet()) {
	    if (p.getKey().equals(fin)) {
	        result.append(p.getKey()).append(" <- ");
	        next = p.getValue();
	    }
	}

	while (next != null) {
	    for (Map.Entry<String, String> p : path.entrySet()) {
	        if (p.getKey().equals(next)) {
	            result.append(p.getKey()).append(" <- ");
	            next = p.getValue();
	            if (next.equals(start)) {
	                result.append(start);
	                next = null;
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}

	return result.toString();
}
```

It will find the end node firstly, and use it as the initial `to`, then it will find its `from` in `path` data, and do this in a loop and it reaches the start point. Let's see the result:

```
Updated cost:fin=2
fin <- b <- start
```

The cheapest path of above graph is _fin <- b <- start_. Now let's try to change the weight of some nodes:

```java
g.addEdge("start", "a", 1);
g.addEdge("start", "b", 10);
g.addEdge("a", "b", 1);
g.addEdge("b", "c", 1);
g.addEdge("a", "c", 1);
g.addEdge("c", "fin", 1);
g.addEdge("b", "fin", 10);
```

The graph becomes:

![Graph]({{ site.url }}/assets/dij03.jpg)

We can see the weight of _start -> b_ and _b -> c_ have been increased. Now let's rerun the algorithm:

```
Updated cost:fin=3
fin <- c <- a <- start
```

We can see the cheapest path has been changed accordingly. Dijkstra's Algorithm is an interesting algorithm and worth studying.
