_Google Scholar_[^scholar] is a very convenient tool to search for publications and citations of these publications. Here is an example to search the book _Grokking Algorithms_[^grokking]:

![grokking]({{ site.url }}/assets/grokking.png)

As the screenshot shown above, you can see there is a `cite` link under the searched book entry. If you click the `cite` link, it will popup a dialog window that show you several different citation styles of text you can use for reference:

![2017-03-06-cite.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-cite.png)

You can choose from one of the styles and copy the text directly into your paper or post. From the above screenshot, you can see there are several different formats we can use to export the citation text, such as `BibTeX`, `EndNote`, `RefMan` and `RefWorks`.

You can choose one of your favorite formats and save the citation locally. For myself, I prefer to save the citation as `BibTeX` format, so I clicked the `BibTeX` link, and then I can get the exported `BibTeX` formatted text like this:

![2017-03-06-bibtex.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-bibtex.png)

Now I can copy the formatted text and paste it into my local `.bib` file:

![2017-03-06-bibfile.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-bibfile.png)

In my local computer, I can use the tools that can support `.bib` file to manage it for future usage. For example, I can use the popular open-sourced tool, _BibDesk_[^bibdesk], to view and manage the citations:

![2017-03-06-bibdesk.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-bibdesk.png)

By maintaining the local `.bib` file properly, I can use these citations for future usages.

As you can see in this article, with the help of _Google Scholar_ and _BibDesk_, I didn't use any commercial softwares to fetch and manage these citations.
