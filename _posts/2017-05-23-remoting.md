title: "Analyzing the JBoss Remoting Protocol"

In this article, I'd like to introduce the `remoting-wireshark` (see [remoting-wireshark](https://github.com/jboss-remoting/remoting-wireshark)) project. This project is a Wireshark [Wireshark · Go Deep.](https://www.wireshark.org/)) dissector plugin that can decode the JBoss Remoting (see [JBoss Remoting](http://jbossremoting.jboss.org/)) protocol.

Here is the screenshot that shows the running Wireshark that is decoding the JBoss Remoting protocol:

From the above screenshot, we can see the `Remoting` protocol is decoded by the Wireshark. 

Now let's see how to enable the plugin. Firstly, you need to clone the `remoting-wireshark` from Github into your local machine:

```url
https://github.com/jboss-remoting/remoting-wireshark
```

Here is the code of the `remoting-wireshark`:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── Makefile
├── src
│   └── main.c
└── target
```

We can see the project just contain a `main.c` and a `Makefile`. I have tested the `Makefile` on my 64-bit Linux box.

At time of writing this article, there is a bug in the project which cause the plugin broken in Wireshark 2.x. I have submitted a PR to fix it (PR3](https://github.com/jboss-remoting/remoting-wireshark/pull/3)) and you can apply the patch if you are running Wireshark 2.x. I have compiled the project in Fedora 25:

```
$ cat /etc/*release
Fedora release 25 (Twenty Five)
```

And I have installed the Wireshark packages:

```
$ dnf search wireshark*
Last metadata expiration check: 23 days, 20:55:45 ago on Sat Apr 29 13:43:24 2017.
wireshark-qt.x86_64 : Wireshark's Qt-based GUI
wireshark-gtk.x86_64 : Wireshark's GTK+-based GUI
wireshark.x86_64 : Network traffic analyzer
wireshark-cli.x86_64 : Network traffic analyzer
wireshark-devel.x86_64 : Development headers and libraries for wireshark
openambit-wireshark.x86_64 : Wireshark dissector for openambit
libvirt-wireshark.x86_64 : Wireshark dissector plugin for libvirt RPC transactions
```

The above packages will provided Wireshark runtime and necessary header files and libraries to build against the remoting project. To compile the project, we can run the `make` command in the project directory, and here is the output:

![/assets/remoting/make.png](/assets/remoting/make.png)
The above screenshot displays the compile process of the package, and the final output is `remoting.so`:

```bash
$ cc -shared -lwiretap -o remoting.so target/main.o
```

After the compilation is done, we need to put `remoting.so` into the plugin directory of the Wireshark. Here is the command to do so:

```bash
$ sudo cp remoting.so /usr/lib64/wireshark/plugins/
```

The above command will put the `remoting.so` into the wireshark plugin diretory defined by Fedora Linux. After the plugin is installed, we can start the Wireshark, and if everything goes fine, the plugin is loaded. We can check the `Analyze` tab in the menu and select the `Enabled Protocols...` item.

![/assets/remoting/option.png](/assets/remoting/option.png)

After clicking the above item, we can see the `Enabled Protocols` window. Here is the screenshot:

![/assets/remoting/remoting.png](/assets/remoting/remoting.png)

The above screenshot shows the enabled protocols. Wireshark will enable many protocols by default, so I have put the string `remoting` into the `Search` field, and it shows that the `Remoting` protocol plugin is already enabled.

To test the plugin, we can use the `jboss-remoting` project itself generate some network traffic and let Wireshark capturing it. Here is the URL of the project:

```url
https://github.com/jboss-remoting/jboss-remoting
```

You can clone the project and use the `mvn install` command to compile and install it into your local machine. I won't dive into much detail into this part. After the compilation is done, we can run the `ConnectionTestCase` provided by the project to generate the network traffic. Here is the screenshot of the class:

![/assets/remoting/port.png](/assets/remoting/port.png)

The above screenshot shows the tcp port used by `ConnectionTestCase` class is `30123`. So we can set Wireshark to listen to `lo` loop interface and filter the data packet to show the data transferred via tcp port `30123`.

To select the interface to capture, we can select the `Capture -> Options...` item as shown in following screenshot:
 
![/assets/remoting/capture.png](/assets/remoting/capture.png)

After click the above item, we enter the following window:

![/assets/remoting/lo.png](/assets/remoting/lo.png)

In above window, we can select the `lo` interface for data capturing. After selecting the interface, we can click the `start` button in above window to start the data capture. Then we will enter the main window of the Wireshark and see data are captured for `lo` interface. Now we need to write a filter to show the data on port `30123` only. Here is the filter setting:
 
![/assets/remoting/filter.png](/assets/remoting/filter.png)

Now the Wireshark is prepared to capture the network data. We can run the `ConnectionTestCase` in `jboss-remoting` project, and it will transfer the network data with `Remoting` protocol. In Wireshark you can see a lot of data packets captured, but they are just decoded as plain TCP packets. Now we can right click one of packet to display the popup window, and select the `Decode As...` item. Here is the screenshot:

![/assets/remoting/decode.png](/assets/remoting/decode.png)


After the clicking the above item, you can see a drop menu that can choose the protocol to use for decoding. Here is the screenshot:

![/assets/remoting/select.png](/assets/remoting/select.png)

And then you can click the `TCP port` and a very long droplist will appear. You can select `JBoss Remoting` as the protocol, and then the packet will be decoded correctly.

After the above steps are done, you will see the JBoss Remoting packets displayed in Wireshark window as shown at the beginning of this article.
