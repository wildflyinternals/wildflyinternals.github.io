title: Usage Of Typographic Ligature In Coding
abstract: In writing and typography, a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes or letters are joined as a single glyph. In this article, I'd like to introduce several fonts that supports ligatures you can use in various coding tools and text editors.

The concept of _Typographic ligature_ is defined like this[^ligature]:

[^ligature]: [Typographic ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature)

> In writing and typography, a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes or letters are joined as a single glyph. An example is the character æ as used in English, in which the letters a and e are joined. The common ampersand (&) developed from a ligature in which the handwritten Latin letters e and t (spelling et, from the Latin for "and") were combined.

The benefit of ligatures is the improvement of the readability of the symbols. Here is a comparison of the fonts that supports ligatures[^firacode] versus the ordinary monospaced[^monospace] one:

[^monospace]: [Monospaced font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font)

As the diagram shown above, the ligatures greatly improved the conciseness and readability of the symbols. There are many monospaced fonts that supports ligatures that we can use in our daily coding work. Here are some popular ones: _FiraCode_, _Hasklig_[^hasklig] and _PragmataPro_[^pragmatapro].

[^monoid]: [monoid: Customisable coding font with alternates, ligatures and contextual positioning. Crazy crisp at 12px/9pt. http://larsenwork.com/monoid/](https://github.com/JB-Dmitry/monoid)

[^pragmatapro]: [PragmataPro™ is a condensed monospaced font optimized for screen, designed to be the ideal font for coding, math and engineering](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/)

Here is a screenshot of using _FiraCode_ in _Atom_[^atom]:

As the screenshot shown above, we can see how the symbols like `==`, `!=`, `>=` are displayed with ligatures enabled.

Not only _Atom_, but many coding tools and text editors are supporting ligatures nowadays, such as _IntelliJ_[^intellij] and _Emacs_. You can check your editors to see if it supports ligatures or not. Here is a screenshot that shows how to enable font ligatures in _IntelliJ_:
