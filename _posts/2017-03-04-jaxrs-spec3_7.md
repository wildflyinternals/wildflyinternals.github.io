_JAX-RS SPEC 2.0_[^spec] shows us how to match a URI path to actual Java method in _Section 3.7_:

[^spec]: ["JSR-000339 The Javatm API For Restful Web Services".](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr339/index.html.) 2017. Jcp.Org.

> 1. Identify a set of candidate root resource classes matching the request
> 2. Obtain a set of candidate resource methods for the request
> 3. Identify the method that will handle the request

To implement the above logic, RESTEasy has provided several classes in package `org.jboss.resteasy.registry`, and here are the classes:

![RESTEasy classes]({{ site.url }}/assets/spec3.7.png)

From the above class diagram, we can see some relationships about these classes. Firstly, there are four `Node` classes, which are `RootClassNode`, `ClassNode`, `RootNode` and `SegmentNode`. Secondly, there one `Expression` interface and its two implementations, which are `ClassExpression` and `MethodExpression`.

From the class name, we can deduce that the `Expression` classes must contain information for matching the URI path. The `ClassExpression` class should be used to match classes, and the `MethodExpression` should be used to match methods.

For the `Node` classes, we can see `RootClassNode` is only connected with `ClassNode`, as its `root` attribute. From the name of the class, we can deduce that `RootClassNode` is the top data structure in matching process. We can verify this deduction later.

Next we should check `ClassNode`. We can see `ClassNode` is connected with `ClassExpression` bidirectionally. `ClassNode` contains `targets` field, which has the type `ArrayList<ClassExpression>`. In another direction, `ClassExpression` has a `parent` field, and the type of the field is `ClassNode`. So this is a _One-To-Many_ relationship: one `ClassNode` instance contains many `ClassExpression` instances.

We need to examine `ClassExpression` now. `ClassExpression` also contains a `root` field, which has a type of `RootNode`. `RootNode` contains a `root` field too, which type is `SegmentNode`.

Now we can check `SegmentNode`. This class has a bidirectional relationship with `MethodExpression`, which is simliar to the relationship between `ClassNode` and `ClassExpression`.

From the above analyze, we can deduce that `RootNode` and `SegmentNode` are two abstract concepts that connects the class matching and method matching processes. The relationship between these classes is like this:

```
RootClassNode -> ClassNode <-> ClassExpression -> RootNode -> SegmentNode <-> MethodExpression
```

So the whole matching process should start from `RootClassNode`. We can verify our deduction by analyzing the real codes in RESTEasy. I have done this work, and I can say that the entry point of the matching process is `ResourceMethodRegistry.getResourceInvoker` method call. Here is the sequence diagram of the method call:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodRegistry.getResourceInvoker.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodRegistry.getResourceInvoker.png)

The above diagram reflects the following codes in `ResourceMethodRegistry.getResourceInvoker` method call:

```java
public ResourceInvoker getResourceInvoker(HttpRequest request)
{
   try
   {
      if (widerMatching) return rootNode.match(request, 0);
      else return root.match(request, 0);
   }
   catch (RuntimeException e)
   {
      throw e;
   }
}
```

We can see that `rootNode : RootNode` and `root : RootClassNode` are used in two different conditions, and the `widerMatching` variable controls the above logic.

The `widerMatching` variable is defined by `ResteasyDeployment` class. In `ResteasyDeployment` class it contains a variable called `widerRequestMatching`:

```java
public class ResteasyDeployment
{
   protected boolean widerRequestMatching;
}
```

And it is set by user controlled `Configuration Switches`[^switch]:

[^switch]: ["RESTFul Web Services for Java - Chapter 3. Installation/Configuration - 3.4. Configuration switches".](https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.1.0.Final/userguide/html/Installation_Configuration.html.) 2017. Docs.Jboss.Org.

![2017-03-10-switch.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-10-switch.png)

From the above screenshot of RESTEasy document, we can see the meaning of ` resteasy.wider.request.matching` switch:

> Turns off the JAX-RS spec defined class-level expression filtering and instead tries to match version every method's full path.

From the above descrption, we can see the switch is to override some _SPEC_ defined behaviors, and the default value is `false`. In this article I'll focus on analyzing the _SPEC_ defined behavior, so I will ignore the logic:

```java
if (widerMatching) return rootNode.match(request, 0);
```

And treat this as the matching logic entry point:

```java
else return root.match(request, 0);
```

Now let's check the `Node` classes. For all the `Node` classes, there are `match()` method inside. Let's check these methods one by one. First is the `match` method of `RootClassNode`:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.RootClassNode.match.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.RootClassNode.match.png)

From above diagram, we can see the call chain like this: `RootClassNode.match() -> ClassNode.match() -> RootNode.match()`. Now let's check the `match` method of `ClassNode`:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.ClassNode.match.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.ClassNode.match.png)

From above digram, we can see the `ClassNode -> RootNode` matching process is complex, and it uses the `ClassExpression` in matching process. We'll check the detail later. Now we should check `RootNode.match()`:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.RootNode.match.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.RootNode.match.png)

We can see `RootNode -> SegmentNode` is easy, because `RootNode.match()` will just call `SegmentNode.match()`. Let's check the sequence diagram of `SegmentNode.match()`:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.SegmentNode.match.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.SegmentNode.match.png)

From the above diagram, we can see `SegmentNode` matching process is simliar to the `ClassNode` matching process, however the `MethodExpression` class is used instead of the `ClassExpression`.

In conclusion, the matching processes are mainly in `ClassNode` and `SegmentNode`. `ClassNode` deals with class matching process, and `SegmentNode` processes the method matching process.

Now let's go back to _SPEC_ document and learn the terminology defined in _Section 1.5_:

![2017-03-10-terminology.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-10-terminology.png)

From the above definitions, we need to understand the definitions of `Resource class`, `Root resource class`, `Sub-resource locator` and `Sub-resource method`.

Now let's check _Section 3.7.2, Request Matching_. If you read through this section, regardless of the detail algorithms, you should catch some basic requirements: Firstly we need to have some candidate resources classes for the matching processes, secondly we need a relative regular expression to each class. This regular expression is actually the pattern of the resource classes that can be checked against the URL requests.

Besides the candidate classes, we also need to have candidate methods inside the classes, and we need to store the relative regular expressions of these methods.

To sum up the above requirements, RESTEasy has provided a `Registry` interface and its implementation, the `ResourceMethodRegistry` class, to support the storage of candidate resource classes.

In addition, we have seen there is an abstract class `Expression` and its two extended classes, `ClassExpression` and `MethodExpression` classes to store the relative regular expressions of the resource classes and methods.

The `Expression` and `Registry` implementations provides basic data unit for multiple `Node` classes to implement their `match()` methods. The finally goal is to get a `ResourceInvoker`, which contains the matched "class.method" and other useful information.

Now let's check the `Registry` firstly, and then let's see `ResourceInvoker`. Here is the class diagram with `Registry` and `ResourceMethodRegistry` included:

![2017-03-10-registry.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-10-registry.png)

From the above diagram, we can see `Registry` is mainly designed to store different kinds of resource classes. The name of `ResourceMethodRegistry` is a little bit confusing, be cause we can see in this class are actually stored resource classes.

We can see `ResourceMethodRegistry` connects with `RootNode` and `RootClassNode`.

We know that `RootClassNode` and `ClassNode` are for class matching, and `RootNode` and `SegmentNode` are for method processing.

And we also know the class and method matching processes are majoyly in `ClassNode.match()` and `SegmentNode`.

We can also see `MethodExpression` is connected with `SegmentNode`, and `ClassExpression` has a `parent` of `ClassNode`, and has a `root` of `RootNode`.

Now let's check the `ResourceInvoker` class:

![2017-03-10-resource-invoker.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-10-resource-invoker.png)

We can see there are two types of `ResourceInvoker`, one is `ResourceLocatorInvoker` and the other is `ResourceMethodInvoker`. The `ResourceMethodInvoker` is for the method finally will be invoked by the request, and the `ResourceLocatorInvoker` is used for invoking `Sub-resource locator`.

There is another important class we haven't investigated till now, the `UriInfo` and `ResteasyUriInfo`:

![2017-03-11-resteasy-uri-info.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-11-resteasy-uri-info.png)

We can see the `UriInfo` interface is in `javax.ws.rs.core` package, which means this is an interface defined by the SPEC that should be implemented by RESTEasy. The `ResteasyUriInfo` is an implementation of this `UriInfo` interface. Here is the javadoc in `UriInfo` that describes the purpose of the interface:

>  An injectable interface that provides access to application and request URI information.

Besides the meaning of encapsulating URI info, it also defines many methods that deals with URI info. Here is the javadoc for `UriInfo.getMatchedURIs()` method:

![2017-03-13-get-matched-uri.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-get-matched-uri.png)

And the `getMatchedURIs()` method in the RESTEasy implementation, `ResteasyUriInfo`, should implement the behavior as described in above text.

The `UriInfo` interface defines the methods to retrieve the URI info, but it doesn't define how to build this info. It depends on the implementation side to build it properly. We can check the `ResteasyUriInfo` to see how does RESTEasy build the URI info. Firstly here is the `initialize` method used by the constructor of `ResteasyUriInfo`:

![org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyUriInfo.initialize.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyUriInfo.initialize.png)

We can see `UriBuilder` and `ResteasyUriBuilder` are involved in the initializing process to build the initial variables. Here are part of the codes in the method:

```java
ResteasyUriBuilder absoluteBuilder = (ResteasyUriBuilder) UriBuilder.fromUri(absoluteUri);
absolutePath = absoluteBuilder.build();
requestURI = absoluteBuilder.replaceQuery(queryString).build();
encodedPath = PathHelper.getEncodedPathInfo(absolutePath.getRawPath(), contextPath);
baseURI = absolutePath;
path = UriBuilder.fromPath(encodedPath).build().getPath();
```

The `UriBuilder` is a SPEC interface, and `ResteasyUriBuilder` is its implementation. Here is the class diagram:

![2017-03-13-uribuilder.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-uribuilder.png)

Here is the javadoc of the `UriBuilder`:

![2017-03-13-uribuilder-doc.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-uribuilder-doc.png)

Here is the javadoc of the `javax.ws.rs.Path` annotation:

![2017-03-13-path.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-path.png)

Here is the javadoc of the `Path.value()` attribute:

![2017-03-13-path.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-path-value.png)

Before going back to `ResteasyUriInfo`, we should check another SPEC interface called `PathSegment`, and its RESTEasy implementation `PathSegmentImpl`:

![2017-03-13-pathsegment.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-pathsegment.png)

Here is the javadoc of `PathSegment`:

![2017-03-13-pathsegment-javadoc.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-pathsegment-javadoc.png)

In _Section 5.3 Client Targets_ of the document, it uses the term "path segment" like this:

![2017-03-13-pathsegment-spec.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-pathsegment-spec.png)

Here is the sequence diagram of `PathSegmentImpl.parseSegmentsOptimization()` method:

![org.jboss.resteasy.specimpl.PathSegmentImpl.parseSegmentsOptimization.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.specimpl.PathSegmentImpl.parseSegmentsOptimization.png)

This method is used to split full URL path into path segments. The javadoc of the method is here:

![org.jboss.resteasy.specimpl.PathSegmentImpl.parseSegmentsOptimization-javadoc.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.specimpl.PathSegmentImpl.parseSegmentsOptimization-javadoc.png)

The above method is used in `ResteasyUriInfo.processPath()` method:

![org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyUriInfo.processPath.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyUriInfo.processPath.png)

As we have built a knowledge base on `UriInfo` and its `UriBuilder`, now we can come back to review the sequence diagrams of the `ClassNode.match()` method and the `SegmentNode.match()` method to see how they use the `UriInfo`. Here is the sequence diagram of the `ClassNode.match()` method we have seen previously:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.ClassNode.match.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.ClassNode.match.png)

Here is the sequence diagram of the `SegmentNode.match()` method:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.SegmentNode.match.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.SegmentNode.match.png)

Here is the whole picture of RESTEasy implementation related with resource matching process:

![2017-03-13-whole-picture.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-13-whole-picture.png)

From the above class diagram, we can clearly see the design of RESTeasy core part. Firstly, the `ResourceMethodRegistry` is the center of these `Node` classes. The purpose of this part is to implement the matching process described in _JAX-RS SPEC 2.0 Section 3.7_. The matching result we finally get is a `MethodExpression`, which has a `invoker` instance. The `Invoker` interface will do the real job to run the Java method, so we can see `ResourceMethodInvoker` is the center of this part. We should remember the call sequence in `ResourceMethodRegistry.getResourceInvoker` we have already seen in above:

![org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodRegistry.getResourceInvoker.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodRegistry.getResourceInvoker.png)

In conclusion, we can see the whole picture is divided into two halves: The bottom half has the `ResourceMethodRegistry` at center with some `Node` classes to do the URL path to `MethodExpression` matching work. The upper half has the `ResourceMethodInvoker` at center, to do the real method running job. The name of `ResourceMethodRegistry` is a little bit confusing, actually it doesn't merely contain and deal with the method information, but also deal with resource classes. Maybe a more proper name should be `ResourceClassAndMethodRegistry`.

We didn't check the upper half in much detail in this article, because this article is focused on the bottom half of the above diagram. In future, I'll write the article that focus on the `ResourceMethodInvoker` side to check how does RESTEasy invoke the matched resource methods.
